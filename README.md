# Portfolio (v1)

Hi!

My name is Juan Fernando Otoya. I'm an Application Developer | Software Specialist at IBM.

This is the source code of my portfolio.

A simple webpage with a backend service to receive messages

---

The front end is developed in React, fully made so it can be scalled.

Backend is stateless, meaning it can also be scalled as needed.

The project also features a CI/CD pipeline with jenkins and github,
so it is build and deployed when a new version is released to the
master branch

---

## Future of the project

Is yet to be added an extra layer of security for the backend.

Will be added measures to prevent abusing the messaging system.

Will add sample projects which show my knowledge as well as all the certificates
I'll be obtaining in the future
